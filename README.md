# VIX-and-C-P-ratio

VIX and Call-to-Put ratio

In this post I want to show that VIX may be predicted by the change in the Call-to-Put ratio.

I outlined two events on the graph that may demonstrate my point.

1. On January 24th, the C/P ratio drops by 25% and the next trading day VIX rises by 21%

2. On February 21st, the C/P ratio drops by 22% and the next trading day VIX rises by 46%

The important condition for this is that the drop of C/P ratio should be below(or around) 1, which would indicate that there is more trading of Puts rather than Calls.

I retrieved the options volume data from #theocc and VIX data from #yahoo and plotted them using #python.
